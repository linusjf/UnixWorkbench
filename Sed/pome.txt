A funny poem by James Reeves

If pigs could fly, I´d fly a pig
To foreign countries small and big-
To Italy and Spain,
To Austria, where cowbells ring,
To Germany, where people sing-
And then come home again.

I´d see the Ganges and the Nile;
I´d visit Madagascar´s isle,
And Persia and Peru.
People would say they´d never seen
So odd, so strange an air-machine
As that on which I flew.

Why, everyone would raise a shout
To see his trotters and his snout
Come floating from the sky;
And I would be a famous star
Well known in countries near and far-
If only pigs could fly!
